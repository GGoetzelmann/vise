# VGG Image Search Engine (VISE)

This tool allows you to search a large database of images and is developed and 
maintained by the [Visual Geometry Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at 
Oxford University.

The original codebase (called `relja_retrival`) was developed by Relja 
Arandjelovic during his DPhil / Postdoc at the Visual Geometry Group, Department 
of Engineering Science, University of Oxford in Sep. 2014. The current codebase 
is developed and maintained by [Abhishek Dutta](adutta@robots.ox.ac.uk).
