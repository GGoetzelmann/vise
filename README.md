# VGG Image Search Engine (VISE)

[VGG Image Search Engine](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vise) (VISE) is an 
open source project developed at the [Visual Geometry Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg) and released under 
the [BSD-2 clause](LICENSE) license. This standalone application can be used to make a 
large collection of images searchable by using image regions as query.

VISE builds on the C++ codebase (relja_retrieval, Sep. 2014) developed by 
Relja Arandjelovic during his DPhil / Postdoc at the Visual Geometry Group, 
Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford. The VISE project
is developed and maintained by [Abhishek Dutta](adutta@robots.ox.ac.uk).

This work is supported by EPSRC programme grant Seebibyte: Visual Search for 
the Era of Big Data ([EP/M013774/1](http://www.seebibyte.org/index.html)).
